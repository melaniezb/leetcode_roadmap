<h1 align ='center'>LeetCode Roadmap [ In Progress ]</h1>

## What is this?

Grinding LeetCode questions for at least 1 month before your upcoming interviews is highly recommended. However, making a 
successful submission to a question does not contribute to your learning curve because you are just pulling out what you've 
already known from your knowledge palace and it at most solidifies your knowledge on that specific point. You might want to :
* think outloud through each step of the way;
* write a complete seudo code before starting the first line;
* go through edge cases before you hit the **run code** button.

Most importantly, you can progress much faster if you have a guide on :
* which LeetCode questions have the similar underlying thinking process, 
* when to re-visit a newly-learnt or not-so-familiar algorithm, and
* how to master a difficult algorithm by looking at it from different angles

This roadmap is made for exactly that purpose. I have ground many LeetCode questions and eventually come to what I call a 
whiteboard-interview style of coding that has helped me the most in technical interviews. I hope this guide can help you
as much as it has helped me.
